    "As the heading says, this is logarithmic, base 2 logarithmic to be exact. This means that somewhere in our algorithm we are dividing the set in two and doing so as n grows. So what might this mean, in terms of solving the problem? We're taking a divide and conquer approach! Just as you would with binary search. Binary search divides the array in half until it finds the correct element. Searching a phone book with 2^32 amount of records would take only 32 tries because we know it is sorted!\n",

Which side do we jump to? We can jump to the left here and divide the set in half, leaving us with the following: ```{1, 3, 4}``` and we're in the middle so we've selected the three here. But, three is only larger than 1 and less than 4 so we have another step to do here and that is to jump to the right, this time we only have {4} left so this is our base case, we only have one item and such this is a peak.\n",
